            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Paul Amusan is a young, energetic, and talented fashion designer 
                who focuses on his men’s clothing line, Paul Amusan. His work 
                draws inspiration from local Nigerian fabrics coupled with 
                Japanese tailoring designs. His designs are masculine, yet 
                modern and trendy by way of transforming an ordinary look 
                into a sophisticated design that embraces elegance. </p>


                <p>I began acquired his love for fashion when he was a young 
                boy where he spent his time sketching and drawing. He loves 
                to work with colors, and his awesome talent has seen his 
                pieces worn by famous politicians and celebrities. Young 
                and successful, he is a talented fashion designer to watch 
                out for as his name continues to cause ripples in both the 
                local and global fashion industries.</p>
                
               <p> While in New York, I was employed in the Charivari Boutique 
                where president of the company, Barbara Weiser, noticed my 
                potential and passion for unique fashion and helped me 
                launch my first fashion collection. My passion for African 
                fashion is profound. “Everything begins for me with the 
                print and fabric, which usually has some shine,” exclaims 
                Faturoti. My deep African roots, as well as extensive global 
                experience with having lived and worked in New York and 
                Milan have been instrumental in her success and 
                international spotlight.</p>
                
                <p> pieces are also sold globally in the UK, US, and France. 
                Anthony uses his talent to make an impact on the community 
                through a mentoring program he runs that helps young and 
                upcoming Nigerian designers excel and compete on a global
                 platform. Nature, colors, and artwork are his main sources
                  of inspiration.</p>
